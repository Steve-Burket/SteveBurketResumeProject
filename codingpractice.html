<h1 style="text-align:center;">HELLO WORLD!</h1>

<p style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">HERE WE GO</p>
<br>
<p> Hi, my name is Steve Burket. This is my first HTML document and is a way for me to practice everything that I've been learning to build websites. I don't know exactly when I became interested in becoming a coder. It kind of feels like I've always been interested in technology but was afraid to take the plunge until recently. I've always found computers interesting since I was a kid. I remember dial up modems and hearing my parents' computer connect to the internet in the mid-90's bringing me into a world of new possibilities. Things have come quite a long way since then and now I'm trying to catch up as quick as I can! I feel like this is still just the beginning of something very exciting and new so I want to be a part of it. I hope to learn as much as I can about coding and put the knowledge to good use to help the world become more connected and effectively communicate with each other. There is great power that lies between the circuit boards and silicon inside these computers so with great power of course comes great responsibility which is why I try to not lose sight of the end goal which is to help humanity become better as well as be conscious that this is only a tool to that end. Fire was an amazing discovery that humans made however long ago and can be used for good as well as bad. So too is the balance with technology. It can be used to create warmth and light but if used ignorantly can yield disastrous outcomes. So, it is very important to remember why I am getting into this which is to create beauty and communicate logic to elevate our universal consciousness. I'm not alone in the endeavor as it takes many people to build greatness; luckily the world is more connected now than ever so I just need to know where to look.</p>
<br>
<p>I started by picking up a book from the library called "Coding For Dummies". When I first started learning guitar I read from the "Guitar For Dummies" book and it was a good start so I figured the same would be for coding which it was. I started with HTML, then started learning a little about CSS, but what I'm really excited for and can't wait to dig into more is Java Script! I want to build interactive websites that gives the user a fun experience! Slowly but surely I would also like to get into Python and as many other languages as I can. As a matter of fact I want to learn everything about computers from hardware to software and beyond. So, I have a long ways to go! Let's keep going!</p>

<p>Fun Facts About Me...</p>
<ul>
    <li>I was born December 25, 1984 at 11:30 pm in Richmond, VA</li>
    <li>My father is Phillip Burket and my mother is Catherine Burket.</li>
    <li>We moved to Omaha, NE when I was 2 or 3. My parents met in Omaha2 or 3 years before I was born.</li>
    <li>My bother, Alex , was born March 10, 1988. I was 3 and have some memories of that time. Like a random memory of walking upstairs in our split level yellow house and hearing my mom cry out as Alex bit down a little too hard while she was feeding him.
    <li>I also remember my grandma Blanca bringing home a cockerspaniel dog home to us one day because she thought it was a stray and needed a home. My mom wanted to name the dog Pooch but for some reason I wanted to name her Terra. I remember arguing with my mom while she was in the bathroom and I was outside the door crying out, "No, her name's not Poochie! It's Terra"! A day came when we found out from Lost Dog posters that she wasn't actually a stray but had a house just a few neighborhoods away. I was sad when my parents told me we had to take her back to her home. I remember walking her with my dad to her real home where the family was happy to see her again. Turned out her real name was Terra! Coincidence, right? Or maybe 3 year olds are better at listening to animals than grown-ups. A few years later when I was 5 we packed up the house to move. I remember always hoping Terra would come back to me to stay. The day before we moved I sat on the same steps where I heard my mom yelp from Alex's aggressive eating habits and saw Terra through the open doorway. She came up to the driveway and gave me a look that said "Goodbye". </li>
    <li>I just learned that the name "Terra" comes from Latin origin meaning "earth".</li>
    <li>In the summer 1990 my family and I moved to Kearney, NE where my dad was starting a new important job. I met the neighbor boy from across the street who was also about to start school that year. His name was Cole Archer and we became good friends for awhile. The first day of kindergarten at Park school was exciting for me but Cole was not as excited and cried.</li>
    <li>My sister, Caitlin, was born November, 12 1990. We were all excited to have a baby sister in the family!</li>
    <li>We moved to Grand Island, NE in the summer of 1992. I started second grade at Stolley Park elementary. My teacher was Mrs. Barrett and she was really nice.</li>
    <li>We moved back to Kearney in the summer of 1996 and I started middle school at Horizon Middle school the year.</li>
    <li>I dabbled with guitar learning some chords and notes from books, including the "guitar for dummies" book, but hit a wall not making any progress so gave it up for a few months. Then, one trip to Greeley, CO to visit family my cousin popped in a CD in the car stereo that would change everything for me. The open guitar playing drew me in and I asked what it was. He said, "It's Led Zeppelin, dude. This is "Stairway To Heaven." When we got back home I immediately got the guitar back out and looked up TABs online to figure out this mysterious guitar riff. I think one of the first sites I used was Ultimate guitar which is still in use to this day.</li>
    <li>We moved to Sioux Falls, SD in the winter of 1999 a week before the turn of the millennium. I remember the Y2K scare and grown-ups freaking out that all the computers were going to go haywire due to a coding issue. My 9 year sister made a bet with our mom that nothing would happen and she took the bet. My sister won the bet.</li>
    <li> We almost moved my junior or senior year to Colorado Springs, CO but I was really against it and my dad didn't want to move me during my final years of high school so I ended up graduating from Roosevelt High School ins 2003.</li>
    <li> I was really on the fence with going to college but my good friend helped me complete the application and he even mailed it in for me. I started college that fall at Minnesota State University of Moorhead and really glad I did.</li>
    <li>I was undeclared my first semester as I really had no clue what to do with the rest of my life and the only passion I had was for guitar and music. One evening my friend, Peter (the good friend who mailed in my application), and I went to check out the Jazz Guitar Ensemble dubbed the Flying V's perform a concert. My mind was blown away by the amazing musicianship, in particular from the senior guitar player Tim Stine and also a sophomore player named Tom Johnson. The next day I declared as a music major and started on track with that degree the following Spring semester.</li>
    <li>In 2006 my roommates decided to start up a bluegrass band which was a novel idea at the time. The only instrument they needed was mandolin so I picked up and haven't put it down since</li>
    <li>After play with the Johnson Family Band I was replaced by someone who was much more proficient as a true Bluegrass player and I ended up joining another group with music classmates, Nate Pitcher and Ross Cameron. We jammed one day and it clicked instantly. We ended up calling our group Inside Out Strings and made a lot of cool music that I'm proud of and recorded a coupe of CDs. We ended up losing steam a few years later so I decide it was time to move</li>
    <li>The eve of New Year's Eve 2011 Inside Out Strings played a show at Dempsey's where I met a person that would change my life forever. After our first set break a pretty girl came up to me and we started talking. I had just gotten out of a long term relationship so was not too interested in starting anything up anytime soon but we exchanged numbers at the end of the night anyway because I thought she was really pretty. She told me her name was Alysia Larson. Now, she's Alysia Burket and we have two beautiful babies together and are in the process of purchasing our first home.</li>
    </li>But before any of that stuff happened we decided to go on an adventure together. In June of 2013 we packed up our bags and cats in a car and a van to move to Denver, CO. We lived there for 4 years, met a lot of cool people, and had a great time eating amazing food enjoying the culture of Denver.</li>
    <li>Alysia and I got married at a Denver courthouse December 2, 2016. It was just the two of us and the way we wanted it. Neither of us every really pictured a big wedding. Too expensive and too much pressure just for a party. We decided we'll have a party celebrating our love someday when we have money.</li>
    <li> Early in the morning of December 9, 2016 our son was born! We named him Braxton Edward Burket and he's the best thing to ever happen to us. He's perfect in every way and I love him with all my heart.</li>
    <li>In March of 2017 we packed up our bags, cats again, and new baby boy to move to Flower Mound, TX to live with my mom. She offered to help us get our feet on the ground as we had no idea how to make it in expensive Denver with a new born. We were very grateful to live with her for 2 years. We made a lot of good memories and good food! And my mom was so happy to have us there.</li>
    <li>Eventually, wondering what the next step would be, Alysia and I decided to come full circle and move back to where we met to Fargo, ND.</li>
    <li>Once again, we packed up and moved to the North country to be closer to old friends and her side of the family, which is also now my family. It was really difficult to move away from my mom again but she understood this was a good move for us. I think. When I first came to this are in 2003 for school I never planned on staying here to plant my roots but it became the town I lived in the longest and became home. There is a lot of potential or growth here and is a good place to raise a family.</li>
    <li> In the early early morning of October 27, 2019 we welcomed our daughter who we named Zinnia Jewel Burket. She is the most beautiful girl in the world and we lover her sooo much! Braxton loves being a big brother to her!</li>
    <li>We lived in an apartment just south of down town for the first year. Then, we decided to purchase our own home! Because why would we continue to pay rent that we'll never see again instead of invest it in a home where we can build memories for our family. After months and months of searching we found a nice little home in Fargo at 915 9th st N to move in to. We close on June 6, 2020. Very exciting and scary at the same time but mostly exciting!</li>
    </li>There's a lot more in between all of that but that's it for now.</li>
